# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one: 
  name: first_user
  encrypted_password: <%= BCrypt::Password.create('secret') %>
# column: value
#
two: 
  name: MyString
  encrypted_password: MyString
# column: value
